\title{Visualize hypotheses' predictions for a Bayesian two-group t-test}
\usage{
visualize_predictions(alternative = function(x) dcauchy(x, scale =
  sqrt(2)/2), n1, n2, from = -6, to = 6, lty = c(1, 1, 2), lwd = 3,
  col = c("#005A31", "red", "black", "orange"), observed_t = NULL,
  frame.plot = FALSE, xlab = "t-value", BFx = from + 0.1,
  BFy = 0.1, BF10 = TRUE, legend_placement = "topleft", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{alternative}{A function object. The default is a Cauchy prior
with scaling parameter `sqrt(2) / 2` as is the default in package
`BayesFactor` (Morey & Rouder, 2015). This argument can also be a
scalar number, in which case it is assumed that the alternative
is a point hypothesis on Cohen's d (with Cohen's d = `prior`).
If `alternative` is NULL, only the null hypothesis predictions
are drawn.}

\item{n1}{The sample size in group 1}

\item{n2}{The sample size in group 2}

\item{from}{the left margin of the x-axis}

\item{to}{the right margin of the x-axis}

\item{lty}{The line type; lty[1] specifies the line type for the null
hypothesis; lty[2] specifies the line type for the alternative
hypothesis; lty[3] specifies the line type for the alternative
hypothesis (only has an effect if an observed effect size is
specified via argument `observed_t`)}

\item{col}{Specify the coloring of the plot. col[1] specifies the
color for the null hypothesis; lty[2] specifies the color for the
alternative hypothesis; lty[3] specifies the color for the line
the illustrates the observed effect (only has an effect if an
observed effect size is specified via argument `observed_t`);
lty[4] specifies the color of the points at the intersection of
the observed effect and the curves for the hypotheses (only has
an effect if an observed effect size is specified via argument
`observed_t`)}

\item{observed_t}{An observed t-value. Does not need to be specified
and defaults to NULL. If this argument is passed, the marginal
likelihoods of the null and the alternative hypothesis are drawn
and a Bayes factor is displayed.}

\item{frame.plot}{Should a frame be drawn?}

\item{xlab}{The label of the x-axis}

\item{BFx}{The x coordinate where the Bayes factor is displayed in
the plot. Only has an effect if an `observed_t` is passed.}

\item{BFy}{The y coordinate where the Bayes factor is displayed in
the plot. Only has an effect if an `observed_t` is passed.}

\item{BF10}{Boolean; defaults to TRUE. Should a Bayes factor be
displayed quantifying the evidence in favor of the alternative
hypothesis? The BF01 is displayed if `BF10` is `FALSE`.  Only has
an effect if an `observed_t` is passed.}

\item{legend_placement}{A keyword passed to `legend` to indicate
where the legend has to be placed. Defaults to "topleft".  Only
has an effect if an `observed_t` is passed.}

\item{...}{additional parameters passed to `curve`}
}
\description{
Visualizes the predictions of the null and an alternative hypothesis.
By specifying an observed effect (observed t-value), an illustration
of the ratio of the marginal likelihoods, i.e., an
illustration of the Bayes factor is displayed.

\examples{
## Using the default cauchy prior
visualize_predictions(n1 = 100, n2 = 100, observed_t = 3, lty = c(1, 1, 2))
## Using a wide Cauchy prior
visualize_predictions(function(x) dcauchy(x, scale = 1), 
n1 = 100, n2 = 100, observed_t = 3, lty = c(1, 1, 2))
## Using a normal prior (M = 0, SD = 0.4)
visualize_predictions(function(x) dnorm(x, 0, 0.4), 
n1 = 100, n2 = 100, observed_t = 3, lty = c(1, 1, 2))
