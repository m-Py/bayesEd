\title{Compute "power" for the default t-test Bayes factor}
\usage{
power_bf(N, effect_size, nsim = 1000, rscale = sqrt(2)/2,
  probability = 0.8, say_result = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{The total sample size over both groups in the independent
groups t test.}

\item{effect_size}{The assumed effect size d.}

\item{nsim}{The number of simulations that are conducted to determine
the "power" of the t test. Increase this number to obtain a more
precise estimate.}

\item{rscale}{The scaling parameter in the Cauchy prior used in the
Bayes factor computation. Defaults to `sqrt(2) / 2`.}

\item{probability}{A scalar indicating the "power". See `Details`.}

\item{say_result}{Boolean. Print a verbal description of the
computation when it is finished?}
}
\description{
For a given N, this function returns the Bayes factor that will be
exceeded with a specified probability in a t-test. Transfers the
frequentist concept of statistical power to Bayes factors. Uses the
default Bayesian t test implemented in the package `BayesFactor`.
}
\details{
For Bayes factors, there is no concept of statistical
    power. However, for a given N and effect size, we can investigate
    the distribution of Bayes factors. Here, "power" then means the
    probability that an observed Bayes factor is at least as high as
    a particular value. We specify this "power" using the parameter
    `probability`. In case of a null-effect, "power" is the
    probability that an observed Bayes factor is smaller than a
    particular value. The function does not analytically determine
    "power", but uses simulation to generate the distribution of
    Bayes factors.

\examples{
## N is the total sample size across two groups
power_bf(N = 200, effect_size = 0.4)
## Null effect:
power_bf(N = 1000, effect_size = 0)
## Small effect size:
power_bf(N = 1000, effect_size = 0.2)
## Vary width of the prior distribution for the alternative hypothesis:
power_bf(N = 1000, effect_size = 0.2, rscale = 0.2)
