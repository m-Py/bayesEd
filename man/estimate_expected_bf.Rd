\title{Simulate the distribution of the t-test Bayes factor}
\usage{
estimate_expected_bf(effect_size, sample_sizes, n_bayes_factors,
  rscale = sqrt(2)/2)
}
\arguments{
\item{effect_size}{The assumed effect size d.}

\item{sample_sizes}{A vector of sample sizes to be used in the
simulation. Means the total sample sizes, i.e., the sample sizes
across the two groups in the t test.}

\item{n_bayes_factors}{How many Bayes factor should be computed. Is
replicated for each of the elements in the vector `sample_sizes`.}

\item{rscale}{The scaling parameter in the Cauchy prior used in the
Bayes factor computation. Defaults to `sqrt(2) / 2`.}
}
\value{
A data.frame in long format where each row represents the
    simulation of a t test. Each row has four columns: `logBF` - the
    natural logarithm of the Bayes factor; `N` - the total sample
    size in the t test; `eff_size` - the effect size; `rscale` - the
    scaling parameter of the prior distribution.
}
\description{
Uses the default Bayes factor employed in the BayesFactor package.
}
\examples{
bfs <- estimate_expected_bf(effect_size = 0.5, sample_sizes = seq(50, 350, by = 50), n_bayes_factors = 300)

## Use `exp` to obtain the "normal" BF that is not logarithmic
tapply(exp(bfs$logBF), bfs$N, median)

## Compare "power" between different sample sizes:
power <- 0.8
tapply(exp(bfs$logBF), bfs$N, quantile,  probs = 1 - power)
